# Hi there, I'm Ajin! 👋
### "Not really a dev" (but I pretend well)

Welcome to my digital playground. I'm a cybersecurity professional who occasionally masquerades as a developer.

---

### 💻 Personality in Patches
- 🐛 **Debugging**: I don't have bugs; I have unexpected features.
- 🔓 **Security**: I break things just to see if I can fix them (50% success rate).
- ☕ **Fuel**: Converting caffeine into code and anxiety.
- 🔄 **Workflow**: `git commit -m "oops"` -> `git push --force` -> Pray.
- 📉 **Optimization**: Living life one buffer overflow at a time.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript (the messy kind), Solidity.
- **Tools**: Burp Suite, Metasploit, and a lot of Google.
- **OS**: Kali Linux (because looking cool is half the job).
